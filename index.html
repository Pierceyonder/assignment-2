<h1>Introduction</h1>

A planet is a <b>celestial body</b>, orbiting a star, that is massive enough to be gravitationally <i>rounded</i> and has “cleared the neighbourhood” around its orbit.

“I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier.”
— Neil Degrasse Tyson

<i>Unfortunately</i>, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. Sometimes I think, <e>Pluto still deserves full planet hood.</e>
